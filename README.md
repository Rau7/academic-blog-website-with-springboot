# Academic Blog Website Project

In this project I used Spring Boot, Hibernate, SQL, Thymeleaf, JPA...

I downloaded both admin page and normal page's theme. So, lots of CSS and JavaScript is not written by me.

You can use it as an example..

If you have questions you can use my mail tokeralp@gmail.com

Have a good day :)
